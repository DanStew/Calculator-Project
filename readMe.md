This is a basic calculator project made using python
The main aim of this project is to understand how to make and manipulate GUIs using python

Eval Function Note : 
The eval function has been used in this case to evaluate the calculation to find the result
However, it can also evaluate Python code
If this program was allowed online, where users were able to try in what they wanted into the calculation, the program could be at risk
If user types in python code and it is run, it can cause risk to who is hosting the system
